                                    You're given tasks that are aimed at helping you hone your skills so as to become a better developer. Every task comes with a deadline. Might be weeks, a week, days or even hours. 
                                    The interns will be working on real life projects for Hotels.ng, get paid for doing this and have a great chance to learn from the very best in Nigeria's tech space.

                                    We have two tracks. The ‘Internship’ track and ‘Learning’ track. The learning track is an easy-going,
                                    unpaid track. The internship track is tougher. People who don’t complete their tasks get disabled from slack.  Some people are here to just Learn, they will be on the learning track (unpaid). 
                                    We will have others on the ‘internship’ track; who will be paid after 1 month. Then we have founders who are just observing, and can build relationships with upcoming coders
